                    <p>I was born at the time of the Islamic revolution in Iran (1979). The revolution resulted in a war with neighboring Iraq that lasted for 8years. I grew up in a chaotic environment, and experienced life in an unjust political society that apparently was harmful, especially for me as a woman; although it did not make me not to think about the deep problems of humankind in this special part of the hemisphere as Middle East and even elsewhere which has been challenging with war condition. Normally there is much intolerable pressure on Middle Eastern people that force them to put their lives at great risk to immigrate, although they have nowhere to go and nowhere to flee. People who bear no responsibility for any of the tragedy that swept up and carried their lives away. People who are going out of their minds with anger and frustration over the constant horror, bombing, and shooting around.
                In my artworks, I am to extract their "suffering" that cannot be explained or written, then I tried to illustrate this feeling like a documentary for the next generations in the hope of taking lessen! 
                As a Middle Eastern child, I was impressed by the TV which was full of warning alarms, war anthems, ruined buildings, and seeing bloody martyrs. Meanwhile, my mother’s decorative and colorful artworks as sculpture and embroidery made my childhood world bearable; hence I tended to do painting and poetry which brought every year awards in school for me. My teachers persuaded me to continue my education in art, especially Graphics, but after graduating with an associate degree I realized my eagerness to work on my personal thoughts and feelings instead of working on others’ destinations as an advertiser. So after taking a competitive exam, I could be accepted in one of the best art universities in Tehran in Painting and learn a lot from the best professors in Iran like Mohammad Ebrahim Jafari who was a painter and poet educated in France.

                  <h3>Samaneh Sarchami</h3>
                  <p>
                    My work is a combination of art practice, journalism, and
                    community building, which aims to bring to light the
                    collective unconscious of Middle Eastern and Far Eastern
                    people who have lived under the horror and constant fear of
                    tension and war. These regions have always been a
                    battlefield for absurd and tragic combats, and the only hope
                    for a foreseeable path to peace in the future is community
                    building and empowering community building. My research
                    widens from the impacts of nuclear weapons, gas chambers,
                    and incinerators in the first half of the 20th century to
                    the use of chemical weapons on Iranians and Kurds by Saddam
                    Hossein's regime fully backed by the Western governments.
                    Clearly, these circumstances resulted in suffering for
                    civilians like their souls are melting. The An Afternoon in
                    Hiroshima and Middle Eve series is directly about this
                    concept. I hope my artworks would be considered as the
                    documentation of the human feelings in an era that trauma
                    and suffering are part of the aesthetics of the day; the
                    work would also act as a tragedy to be cathartic and to
                    increase awareness of its audiences. Based on the Reflection
                    Theory hypothesized by Lucas, my artworks could re-show the
                    reality of the human condition so we could perhaps vividly
                    observe what we have done. The imagery of these series was
                    inspired by Kathe Kollwitz's rough and outspoken drawings as
                    well as the brush works in Marlene Dumas's images. I am also
                    the founder of the A Room for One's Own group. The name was
                    taken from Virginia Wolf's book. The group activities were
                    about women's empowerment in the form of protest poems. Over
                    two years, we invited about 70 artists to Mashhad from in
                    and out of the country for two reasons. First, women can
                    meet and connect with accomplished female artists in order
                    to be inspired to pursue their own goals and dreams. Second,
                    to create an international community of artists and
                    non-artists from Iran, Afghanistan, China, Japan, Canada,
                    and England to read poems together to emphasize the erasing
                    of borders in our minds that the aggressive patriarchal
                    politics have drawn between us.
